    # Hacking Human Trafficking

    ### 🗓️ May 8th, 2023 @ 5-9pm  
    ### 🏛️ MIT Room 56-169 @ Cambridge, MA, USA

    ------------------------

    Join us for an evening of brainstorming about how technology can help
    in the fight against human trafficking, a hands-on workshop on using
    data science to do so, and a mini-hackathon with other participants.

    After a keynote addressing human trafficking in general, we'll focus on
    the illicit massage industry and explore practical questions such as: 

    - How large is the industry (e.g. what do people self-report spending?)
    - What policies are there about the IMI?
    - How big of an impact did COVID have on the IMI? 


    **Trigger Warning:** This data in this hackathon can contain sexually explicit and vulgar text.

    # FAQ 
    ------------------------

    **What is Hack4Fem?** Hacking for Feminism was a hackathon run in 2016.  We are reusing the site to revive the general topic of applying technology to social justice goals. For more information see: 
    https://web.archive.org/web/20161022164653/http://hack4fem.org/schedule.html

    **I'm interested in helping organize!**
    Awesome, definitely welcome help -- email us at the address above!

    **I already do research in the area of AI + counter-trafficking, should
    I come?**

    Yes! Separately from this hackathon-workshop, we hope to build a community of researchers working on this topic.

    **I can't attend but will this be held again in the future?** 

    Yes! We plan to hold a follow-up hackathon in September 2023. Email us
    for more details :)
